# Backhand Developer

The project is based on ATP ranking data coming from ultimatetennisstatistics.com. 
Data is loaded into table rankings_raw and from there it is transformed into stg_rankings and int_players.
The goal is to export the data such that it can be used to create a streamgraph visualization of all players since the beginning of the ATP rankings.
